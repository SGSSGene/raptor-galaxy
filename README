# raptor-galaxy

This is currently a test repository to try how to upload seqan3 based apps to galaxy tool shed


## How to upload to testtoolshed
- Notice: updating to the toolshed seems to only work if the version of <tool> is adjusted.
- (assuming that planemo is installed and sourced)
- create account at https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu
- run `$ planemo config_init` to create a planemo config
- insert shed_username and api key into ~/.planemo.yml
- run `$ planemo shed_update --shed_target testtoolshed path/to/this/repo` to publish the tools of this repository

## Creating a new tool
- copy raptor-build.xml to raptor-newsubcommand.xml
- adjust the xml file to own needs
- run `$ planemo test raptor-newsubcommand.xml` to check tests
- run `$ planemo lint raptor-newsubcommand.xml` to lint
